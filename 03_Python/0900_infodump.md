# Informatie over python

## Terminologie
- REPL = an interactive shell, short for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop
- Variable = A variable is used to store information that can be referenced later on.
- string = just text
- interger = whole number
- float = decimal number

## functions

- print() = print to screen   
- type() = determine a variable or expression type  
- input() = user input  
- int(variable) = change variable to interger   
- str(variable) = change variable to string
- len(list) = give length of a list
- def func() = define custom function
- if elif else: = if if if if if ...... else = do something if statement is true
- while True = while loop **Be sure to create a break in the loop or it will continue forever (ctrl-c to exit)**
- for x in range() = for loop with range
- import = import library into code
- random.randint(x, x) = random interger in range from start to stop




|Escaped sequence| What it does| 
|---|---|
  \n|	A newline (Newlines are generated with your return key). Advances to the next
 \r |Carriage return: takes you back to the start of the line, without advancing to the next line    
 \t	|A tab character
\ \ | The slash character itself: because it is used as the start of escape sequences, we need to escape this character too. Python is quite forgiving if you forget to escape it, though. (\ \ - space [thx .md])
