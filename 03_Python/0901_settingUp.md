# Setting up

## Introduction
For a lot of IT jobs, some basic programming knowledge is required. You do not have to be able to write a script from scratch, or understand complex algorithms. You will have to be able to understand and modify code snippets to fit your needs.
For this, it is important to learn the basic principles of programming. Python is often considered the easiest programming language to learn, because the syntax is very simple.When installing Python, make sure to add Python to your PATH variable (even if you’re on Windows).In order to start writing code, you’ll need an IDE. The most popular IDE is Visual Studio Code (VS Code), because it is free, lightweight, easy to use, and there are a lot of plug-ins available for high customizability.

Everyone will use the same version of Python, and the same IDE. This way, it will be easier to work together.

## Exercise
Write the following Python code. The output in the terminal should be the text “Hello world!”

### Code

    # Print Hello World! in Console
    print("Hellow World!")

*script1.py*

### Output
![Hello World](../00_includes/0901_helloworld.png)
